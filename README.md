# get_appraisals

# Setup config
```cp get_appraisals_template.cfg to get_appraisals.cfg```

Modify the get_appraisals.cfg for your neighboorhood and CAD urls

At a minimum you need to modify the report_name, property_url, property_notice, user_agent and download a report for your neighborhood with the property_id's you want to use. I downloaded all of them for my neighborhood.

For the property_id's you need to place it in the data directory and name it the same as your report_name with the '.input' extension. i.e. neighborhood.input
